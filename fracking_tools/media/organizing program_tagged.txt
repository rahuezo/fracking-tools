What Ive Been Doing When we first spoke about creating a program that organizes folders, I was shown the Newspaper aggregating folder. Newspaper aggregating contains 280 municipality folders. Each municipality folder contains a set of newspaper folders. Each newspaper folder can either contain a list of documents (.pdf, .txt, .docx) or more subfolders with documents. To organize the Newspaper aggregating folders, I followed these steps: Part 1 Create empty copies of the Newspaper aggregating municipality folders in a separate folder called ORGANIZED_NEWSPAPERS Within each empty municipality folder, create empty newspaper folders and an additional Unknown Municipality (Irrelevant) folder. Within each empty newspaper folder, create empty year folders (2008-2014) and an additional Unknown Year folder. Part 2: Taking Newspaper aggregatingAdams Village as an example Navigate through each newspaper folder within Adams Village Focusing on DailyGazette, read each file within this folder and check whether the municipality name (i.e. Adams) appears within the text. If <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> exists in the text, then the current file belongs to the ORGANIZED_NEWSPAPERSAdams VillageDailyGazzete folder. If no municipality can be determined, then this file belongs to the ORGANIZED_NEWSPAPERSAdams VillageUnknown Municipality (Irrelevant) folder. After determining what municipality a file belongs to, look for a year between <DATE>2008</DATE> and <DATE>2014</DATE> within the filename. If no year is found within the filename, then look at the contents of the file and choose the first occurrence of a year as the year the file belongs to. If no valid year is found within the file, then the file belongs to the Unknown Year folder. Still focusing on Newspaper aggregatingAdams VillageDailyGazette and the file FrackingAMEDORE MUST CLARIFY P.txt, by reading this file we conclude that <PERSON>Adams</PERSON> does not appear within the text and therefore it belongs to the Unknown Municipality folder. Then, since a valid year doesnt appear within the filename or within the text, FrackingAMEDORE MUST CLARIFY P.txt will be copied to ORGANIZED_NEWSPAPERSAdams VillageUnknown MunicipalityUnknown Year. This same procedure applies to all folders and all files within Newspaper aggregating Then <PERSON>Gwen</PERSON> told me there were missing folders that appeared in the Diffusion pilot spreadsheet that werent in Newspaper aggregating. In this spreadsheet I created a column called Newspaper Folder List. Under this column, for each municipality, I entered a list of corresponding newspaper folders (found at Dropbox\Fracking Project). If you look at Afton Town, it has 3 associated newspapers: TriTown News, EveningSun, and thedailystar. Once the Newspaper Folder List was complete, I made a program that would create municipality folders for each municipality in Diffusion pilot that did not exist in Newspaper aggregating. Then I created folders for the respective newspaper folders for each municipality folder. Taking Afton Town as an example: I first created a folder called Missing Muni Folders (at <ORGANIZATION>Dropbox\Fracking Networks Data Collection</ORGANIZATION> 2015\Newspaper Aggregating and Missing Munis\Missing Muni Folders). Within this folder I created the folder Afton Town. Within Missing Muni FoldersAfton Town I created the folders EveningSun, thedailystar, TriTown NewsAkila (these are the literal folder names found at Dropbox\Fracking Project). Once these folders were created, I copied over all the newspaper files that belonged to EveningSun, thedailystar, TriTown NewsAkila. I did this for ALL municipalities in this spreadsheet. The finished folder Dropbox\Fracking <ORGANIZATION>Networks Data Collection 2015\Newspaper Aggregating and Missing Munis\Missing Muni Folders</ORGANIZATION> has the same structure as the Newspaper aggregating folder. So after creating all the missing municipality folders, I ran the organizing program described above. Im currently ~80% done with all the organization. In the end, all the folders from Newspaper aggregating and Missing Muni Folders, will be organized at <ORGANIZATION>Dropbox\Fracking Networks Data Collection 2015\ORGANIZED_NEWSPAPERS.</ORGANIZATION>
